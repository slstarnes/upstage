# Contribution Guide

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.

## Bug Reports and Enhancement Requests

Bug reports and enhancement requests are an important part of making UPSTAGE more stable and are curated though [Github issues](https://github.com/gtri/upstage/issues). If you wish to contribute, then please be sure there is an active issue to work against and there is not then go ahead and create one.

## Create a Fork

You will need your own copy of UPSTAGE (aka fork) to work on the code. Go to the [UPSTAGE project page](https://github.com/gtri/upstage) and hit the `Fork` button.

## Making Code Changes

If you wish to contribute to UPSTAGE, we ask that you follow these steps to ensure code quality.

### Development Environment Setup

First, create a Python 3.11 or 3.12 environment through your preferred means (conda, mamba, venv, e.g.).

```bash
python -m venv /path/to/upstage_dev/.venv
```

Ensure that the pip version is >= `21.3` to allow editable installations with just `pyproject.toml`
and the `flit` backend.

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Next, clone the repo locally:

```bash
cd /path/to/upstage_dev
git clone https://github.com/gtri/upstage.git
cd upstage
```

Install UPSTAGE to your environment with

```bash
pip install -e '.[docs,lint,test]'
```

### Style Guide

For style, see [STYLE_GUIDE](STYLE_GUIDE.md).

### Code Quality

Code quality is enforced using the following tools:

1. [`pyproject-fmt`](https://pyproject-fmt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - pyproject.toml formatter
2. [`ssort`](https://pyproject-fmt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - source code sorter
3. [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) - linter and code formatter
4. [`mypy`](https://mypy-lang.org/) - static type checker

These tools are run as follows, allowing for auto-fixing:

```bash
# formatters
pyproject-fmt pyproject.toml
ssort src
ruff format src
# linting and type checking
ruff check --fix src
mypy --show-error-codes -p upstage
```

### Testing

To run the unit tests in `src/upstage/test`, run:

```bash
pytest
```

from the top level of the repo.

Test reports will be in `./build/reports`

### Building the documentation

Documentation is built from autodocs first, then the source build.

From the top level of the repo:

```bash
sphinx-apidoc -o ./docs/source ./src/upstage ./src/upstage/test
sphinx-build -b html ./docs/source ./build/docs
```

Then the docs can be loaded from `./build/docs/index.html`

## Making Pull Requests

The valid target for all pull requests is `dev`. Please ensure that your pull request includes
documentation and explanation for its purpose and sufficient documentation to explain its usage.
