    No input is needed for the state if you define a default resource class in
    the class definition and do not wish to modify the default inputs of that
    class.

    The input an Actor needs to receive for a ResourceState is a dictionary of:
    * 'kind': <class> (optional if you provided a default)

    * 'init': <numeric> (optional, works on containers)

    positional argument. This is to maintain compatibility with simpy.
